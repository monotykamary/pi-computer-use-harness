# Troubleshooting

## The Helper Is Missing Or Not Executable

Reinstall the helper from the package:

```bash
node scripts/setup-helper.mjs --runtime
```

Or build it locally:

```bash
node scripts/build-native.mjs --output ~/.pi/agent/helpers/pi-computer-use/bridge
```

Confirm the helper exists:

```text
~/.pi/agent/helpers/pi-computer-use/bridge
```

## macOS Permissions Still Fail

Grant both permissions to the helper:

```text
~/.pi/agent/helpers/pi-computer-use/bridge
```

Required permissions:

- Accessibility
- Screen Recording

If macOS still denies access:

1. Remove the helper from the permission list.
2. Add it again.
3. Restart Pi.
4. Retry `screenshot`.

## Non-Interactive Setup Fails

Permission setup requires an interactive Pi session because macOS permission panes are user-controlled.

Start Pi interactively, grant permissions, then retry the non-interactive workflow.

## A Browser Says JavaScript From Apple Events Is Disabled

Some browser automation paths require the browser's per-app **Allow JavaScript from Apple Events** setting. If a browser returns the related Apple Events error, the tool error includes a model-readable hint to ask the user to enable the setting in the browser's developer menu, then retry the browser action.

macOS/browser vendors do not provide a safe way for Pi to enable this setting automatically.

## Browser Windows Are Refused

Check the effective config:

```text
/computer-use
```

If `browser_use` is disabled, enable it in one of:

```text
~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-computer-use.json
.pi/computer-use.json
```

Example:

```json
{
  "browser_use": true
}
```

## Strict AX Mode Blocks An Action

Strict AX mode blocks:

- raw pointer events
- raw keyboard events
- foreground focus fallbacks
- cursor takeover
- non-AX browser bootstrap

Use AX refs from the latest `screenshot`, open a dedicated browser window manually, or disable strict AX mode for workflows that require raw event fallback.

## Coordinates Are Rejected As Stale

Coordinates are valid only for the latest screenshot state. Call `screenshot` again and retry with the new `stateId`.

## An AX Ref Is Missing Or Stale

AX refs are scoped to the latest semantic state. Call `screenshot` or `wait` to refresh the target list.

The bridge attempts stale-ref recovery for compatible role, label, capability, and position matches, but not every stale ref can be safely recovered.

## Screenshot Or Window Capture Fails

Confirm:

- Screen Recording is granted.
- The target app has an open, controllable window.
- The window is not closed or hidden between `screenshot` and action.
- You are running on macOS.

If the target is ambiguous, call `screenshot` with both app and window title:

```ts
pi-computer-use screenshot --app TextEdit --windowTitle "Untitled"
```
